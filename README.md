# Clare 👩🏻‍🔬
Clare is an AI agent for coding, a VSCode extension.

Clare is a hard fork of Cline and it includes these differences:

## Features
- added [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com) as main LLM provider
- simplified UI (less buttons in header)
- **API latency display** (so you can see how fast your requests are)
- **API ratelimiting** (you can set for example 2 req/min max). Useful for free models like google gemini
