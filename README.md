# Clare 👩🏻‍🔬
Clare is an AI agent for coding, [a VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tot-ra.clare) that uses [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com) as LLM provider
Clare is a hard fork of Cline and it includes these changes:

## Features
- simplified UI (less buttons in header, reordering of mcp settings)
- removed snapshotting logic to have better performance
- **API latency display** (so you can see how fast your requests are)
- **API ratelimiting** (you can set for example 2 req/min max)
- added task retry (in case you practice taking next task from TODO.md)
