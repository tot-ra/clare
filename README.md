# Clare 👩🏻‍🔬
Clare is a [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com) AI agent for coding, a VSCode extension.

Clare is a hard fork of Cline and it includes these differences:
- added Clarifai as main LLM provider
- simplified UI (less buttons in header)
- API latency display (so you can see how fast your requests are)
- API ratelimiting (you can set for example 2 req/min max). Useful for free models like google gemini
